# IFML-Bomberman

Clone of https://github.com/ukoethe/bomberman_rl.git.

We added some minor changes we made to the environment, and our own agent.

NOBEL-COIN is a version of our agent that can only collect coins, however it is quite good at it.

NOBEL-CRATES is a version that can deal with bombs and crates, but was not trained with enemies.

NOBEL-SEMIFINAL is a version that can play the full game. It is a preliminary version from which we continued training.

NOBEL-FINAL is a version that can play the full game. It is also the version we submitted for the competition.

NOBEL is a version that does not load a trained model. However, it contains the raw files from which all our plots were generated, and the functions to generate those plots.
