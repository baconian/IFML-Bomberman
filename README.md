# IFML-Bomberman

Clone of https://github.com/ukoethe/bomberman_rl.git.

We added some minor changes we made to the environment and our own agent.

NOBEL-COIN is a version of our agent that can only collect coins, however it is quite good at it.

NOBEL-CRATES is a version that can deal with bombs and crates, but was not trained with enemies. It is not bad, but there is certainly a lot of room for improvement.

NOBEL-FULL is a version that can play the full game. It is also the version we submitted for the competition.
